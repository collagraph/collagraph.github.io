## Design for use

We design websites, tools and systems for people to use and work in. They should be able to quickly achieve what they want to achieve and enjoy what’s there. A design that is simple and helpful is a pleasure to use. A design that confuses and forces you down a convoluted path is frustrating&mdash;these experiences reflect on the website’s owner. It is inspiring to use something that *just works*.

Information that is easy to understand and consume is more useful.

## All websites change

A website is like a building: over time different people will use it, and will want to use it in different ways; innovation will bring useful new technologies and make others obsolete; climates and cultural context will transform around it. Many people are used to websites that get more confusing and complex over time; information gets lost and navigation becomes a lottery.

Websites *can* be designed to accommodate change over the long term and improve with time. Adaptability is worth a lot. At its core is:
-   well planned, structured content and metadata;
-   clean, documented, reusable code; and
-   frank, close communication between designers, clients and users.

As architects return to review a building, designers of a system in use should periodically return to review and respond to changes.

## Nothing is arbitrary

Every detail pushes a website closer to or further from its design principles; every element makes something more or less usable. As Dieter Rams said, “care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.”

## Strive for universal accessibility

People are using online services from a staggering variety of devices and contexts. Show respect to all potential users, provide them with useful tools and information no matter how they want to access it: mobile, screen reader, desktop, tablet, video game console, search engine, etc. .

A crucial aspect of accessibility is the ability of people with special access requirements to use online services, users with reduced vision for example. It is also about the ‘machine readability’ of the website. Search engines, social networks and other services should be able to easily get the information in the site so it can be displayed in their service at its best. Accessibility comes down to a core belief that everybody should be able to use and enjoy the service you provide.

 Universal accessibility is an [original design principle of the web](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#universal-access).

## Good design makes society better

Bad design damages and pollutes our ecosystem and society. It contributes to waste, noise and corruption of all forms. Good design does the opposite. Designers should be held responsible for their contributions to the world.
