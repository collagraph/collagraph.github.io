	<h2>Our approach</h2>
	
	<p class="distinct">Collagraph is a Sydney based web design partnership, founded by Robert Irish and Luke Bacon.</p>

	<p>Good design is focused. We help clients define and zero-in on their specific challenges and opportunities, then build websites with distinctive design and solid infrastructure that put them in control of their presence online. Good design makes a difference for your business or organisation.</p>
	
	<p>We’re passionate about contemporary best-practices, precise usability and open source technology so that you don’t have to be. We put clients in-front of their audience’s changing needs, such as accessing information from a range of devices and navigating an evermore networked, social web.</p>
	
	<p>The best design for your project makes your message understood and the value you offer clear.</p>
